# Dependency Injection in FastAPI

This project demonstrates the concept of **Dependency Injection** (DI) in FastAPI. Dependency Injection is a design pattern that allows objects to be passed into a class or function, rather than the class or function creating those dependencies itself.

## What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection (DI) is a technique used to achieve **Inversion of Control** (IoC). It helps to make code more modular, testable, and maintainable by allowing you to inject external dependencies (like services, configurations, and databases) into a function or class instead of hard-coding them.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: Instead of a function or class creating its own dependencies, the dependencies are provided from the outside.
2. **Loose Coupling**: By injecting dependencies, the components are not tightly bound to each other, making it easier to modify or replace parts of the system without affecting other parts.
3. **Testability**: Dependency Injection makes unit testing easier by allowing mock dependencies to be injected during testing.
4. **Reusability**: Components can be reused easily because they are not directly dependent on other classes.

### How Dependency Injection works in FastAPI:
In FastAPI, dependencies are injected into the path operations via the `Depends` function. Dependencies can be simple functions or even complex classes that can handle specific tasks like database connections, authentication, etc.

### Example of Dependency Injection in FastAPI:

Here is a simple example where a function `get_simple_goal` is used as a dependency and injected into the route handler:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends

app = FastAPI()

# Simple Dependency
def get_simple_goal():
    return {"goal": "We are building AI Agents Workforce"}

@app.get("/get-simple-goal")
def simple_goal(response: dict = Depends(get_simple_goal)):
    return response

In the above example:
. The get_simple_goal function is defined to return a dictionary.

. The Depends function injects this dependency into the route handler simple_goal.

Why Use Dependency Injection?
Separation of Concerns: It separates the logic of a function/class from the logic of managing dependencies.

Maintainability: Makes code easier to manage and extend, especially in large applications.

Testability: Allows easier testing by injecting mock or dummy dependencies.

Flexibility: You can replace or modify dependencies without changing the logic of the application.
